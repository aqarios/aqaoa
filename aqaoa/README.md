## Overview

CUAOA is a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the [NVIDIA CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core.

## Original Project Attribution

This project is based on [CUAOA](https://github.com/jflxb/cuaoa). CUAOA is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) files for details.

## Changes from CUAOA
- Renamed most user visible instances of `cuaoa` to `aqaoa` in the code

## Installation

To include this project in your Rust project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): Required to compile the Rust libraries.
- [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/): Required to compile the C++ library.
- [CUDA and nvcc](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads): Required for CUDA-accelerated computations and the compilation.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/): Required for cloning the repository.
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html): A crucial tool for environment and package management.

Additionally, the `cuStateVec` and `libLBFGS` libraries need to be installed. The installation script handles these dependencies, but ensure you read and understand their licensing terms, as well as the licensing terms of the other dependencies:

- [`cuStateVec License`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/custatevec/license.html)

> **NOTE:** The build process currently requires using conda for the installation, and a conda environment is required. This dependency on conda is subject to change in a future release of the library.

### Using with Cargo

To use the AqAOA Rust subpackage in your project, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aqaoa = { git = "https://github.com/aqarios/aqaoa", branch = "main" }
```

This will pull the AqAOA package from the specified GitHub repository.

### Security Note

> **CAUTION:** Including external dependencies from GitHub or other sources poses a risk. It is recommended to review the source code of the dependencies to ensure they meet your security and functionality requirements.

### Troubleshooting

> **TIP:** If you encounter any issues during installation:
>
> - Double-check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) to ensure all necessary tools are installed.
> - Verify that the `cargo` command is available and properly configured in your development environment.
> - Review permissions if encountering errors related to script execution or repository access.
